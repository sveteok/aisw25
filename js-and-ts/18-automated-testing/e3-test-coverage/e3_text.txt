Exercise 3: Test Coverage
Run your tests with --coverage flag. See what parts of your calculator are being tested and what are not. If you don't yet have 100% coverage, write a few more tests.

Add another function, reverse to functions.ts. What is the minimum amount of test code you can write to get your coverage back to 100%.
 - create test for reverse function for 100% coverage
