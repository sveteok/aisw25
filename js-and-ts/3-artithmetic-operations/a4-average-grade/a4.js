/*
Your friend is making a program for calculating their average grade. However, it doesn't give the correct result, and they're not sure why.

Fix their code so that the average grade is calculated correctly.

const grade1 = 8;
const grade2 = 10;
const grade3 = 7;

const gradeCount = 3;

const averageGrade = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 / gradeCount;

console.log(averageGrade);
*/

const grade1 = 8;
const grade2 = 10;
const grade3 = 7;

const gradeCount = 3;

const averageGrade = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / gradeCount;

console.log(averageGrade);
