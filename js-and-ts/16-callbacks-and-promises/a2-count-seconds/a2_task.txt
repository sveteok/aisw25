a)
Create an async function waitFor that takes in a number (milliseconds) as a parameter.

When called, the function must wait for the specified amount of time to pass before returning, without doing anything else.

Tip: setTimeout wrapped in a Promise + await.

b)
Create an async function countSeconds that prints numbers from 0 to 10.

Between printing each number, the program must call waitFor and await the function to complete. 
This makes the program wait exactly 1 second before printing the next number.

Call your countSeconds function. If you did these steps correctly, your program should print numbers from 0 to 10, w
ith a delay of 1 second between each number appearing on the terminal.
