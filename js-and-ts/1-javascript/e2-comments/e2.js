/* Create a program that prints "Hello World" in a few different natural languages. 
Check that your program works as expected.
Afterwards, comment out one of the lines and test the behaviour of your program again.
Try out the keyboard shortcuts for commenting as well. */

// This prints "Hello World" in a few different natural languages.
console.log("Hello World");
console.log("Hei maailma");
console.log("Привет, мир");

// Fast way to comment blocks of code in and out is to use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + ' (the key next to the enter-key)
// shift+command+7 for mac
