In this assignment, we make use of the Fake Store API: https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

a)
Create a function named getFakeStoreProducts() that fetches all products from the Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and prints the names of the products.

getFakeStoreProducts();
// prints:
// Mens Casual Premium Slim Fit T-Shirts
// Mens Cotton Jacket
// Mens Casual Slim Fit
// John Hardy Women's Legends Naga Gold & Silver Dragon Station Chain Bracelet
// Solid Gold Petite Micropave
// White Gold Plated Princess
// ...
// etc
b)
Check the Fake Store documentation on how to "add" a new product to the store.

Then, create a function named addFakeStoreProduct that takes 4 parameters: name, price, description and category.

The function should POST the product information to the Fake Store API products endpoint (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and 
then print the ID of the added product. If you made your request successfully, the Fake Store API endpoint will return you the ID of your new product.

(Note that no new products are actually created to the Fake Store backend, so you won't see your new product in the product list if you fetch it afterwards)

c)
Check the Fake Store documentation on how to "delete" a product from the store.

Then, create a function deleteFakeStoreProduct that takes the product's ID as a parameter.

The function should make a DELETE request to the Fake Store API products endpoint with the given product ID.

If successful, the Fake Store API returns the deleted product. Print the name of the product that was deleted.
