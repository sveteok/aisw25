FILE I/O - Dumb chatbot
Create a chatbot command line program.

You'll be needing some command line input from the user with the following exercise, and for that you'll need the readline-sync package

npm init
npm install --save readline-sync
Then, try using it:

npm i --save-dev @types/readline-sync

import readline from "readline-sync";
const answer = readline.question("Give me an answer: ");
console.log(answer);
The command line application
This is a really common exercise that almost every programmer does at some point in their career. The reason it’s so common, is because through this you have to use a lot of different types of variables and various operations.

The base for all applications are their UI and this is the case in this application as well. Below you’ll see what your application should say when you run it the first time.

Hi! I am a dumb chat bot You can check all the things I can do by typing 'help'.

Now the after logging out the text above, you will have to wait for the user input. There’s a lot of different options for the user at this point, but let’s define the behavior for the help command first.

The 'help' command
If the user writes help in to the command line, the text below should be logged out. You don’t have to worry about the commands listed in the text yet, but this is what your program should do when the user gives you this input.

-----------------------------
Here´s a list of commands that I can execute! 

help: Opens this dialog.
hello: I will say hello to you
botInfo: I will introduce myself
botName: I will tell my name
botRename: You can rename me
forecast: I will forecast tomorrows weather 100% accurately
quit: Quits the program.
-----------------------------
Sample output of using all commands
hello command
If the user writes hello in to the command line, you should open a dialog that asks the users name and after that say hello to user with given name. Whenever the user answers these questions you should store the answers in to their respective variables. The literal implementation is up to you. Below is a sample dialog described for you. (The bolded text is user input).

hello
What is your name?
Dan Ackers
Hello there, Dan Ackers!

botInfo command
If the user writes botInfo in to the command line, you should console.log info or introduction about the bot itself. Also command botInfo will output a counter value of asked questions (commands runned).

That means like so:
hello -> counter = 1
botInfo -> counter = 2
botInfo -> counter = 3
etc.

The implementation is up to you. Below is the dialog described for you. (The bolded text is user input).

botInfo
I am a dumb bot. You can ask me almost anything :). You have already asked me n questions.

botName command
If the user writes botName in to the command line, you should console.log bot's current name. Bot's default name should be defined (choose your own default name)

The implementation is up to you. Below is the dialog described for you. (The bolded text is user input)

botName
My name is currently current name. If you want to change it, type botRename.

botRename command
If the user writes botRename in to the command line, you should open a dialog that asks the user multiple questions. The implementation is up to you. Below is the dialog described for you. (The bolded text is user input)

botRename
Type my new name, please.
Arnold
Are you happy with the name Arnold?
Yes
I was renamed to Arnold

or

botRename
Type my new name, please.
Arnold
Are you happy with the name Arnold?
No
Name not changed. My name is ${previousName}.

botRename will overwrite default/previous name, so if you run botName after renaming it, you should get renamed name logged out.

forecast command
If the user writes forecast in to the command line, you should forecast tomorrows weather randomly from multiple choises.
The implementation is up to you. Below is an example of desired output.

forecast
Tomorrows weather will be....
Temperature: 20 celsius degree
Cloudy: yes
Sunny: no
Wind: yes

quit command
If the user writes quit in to the command line, program should quit.
