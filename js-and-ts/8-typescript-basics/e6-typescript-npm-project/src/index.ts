/*
Following lecture instructions, create a TypeScript NPM project.

Your program should print a "Hello TypeScript" message, like in Assignment 1.

The user should be able to compile and run the project using NPM scripts.

Remember to:

Install both typescript and @types/node as dev dependencies
Configure "types": ["node"] in tsconfig.json
Set "outDir": "./dist" in tsconfig.json
Bonus: Test your code with tsx during development before building the project.
*/

console.log("Hello TypeScript");
