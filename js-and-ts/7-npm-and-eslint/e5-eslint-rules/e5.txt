Add rules to

1. give only warning for unused variables
2. give an error if user does not use curly braces on if statements
3. give a warning if there's console.log calls in the code
Refer to the ESLint rules reference - https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules 

Write some code that uses single quotes and does not use semicolons. Then run your linter to make sure the problems are caught

Extra: By default, ESLint gives an error for unused variables. Migitate this to warning only.
