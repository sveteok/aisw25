Create a new folder for this exercise. Use command line to navigate into this folder. Initialize a project:

npm init -y
Note that the installation created package.json file. Check out it's contents. 
Next install a small npm package called camel-case. 
It is a package that is not very useful for us right now, 
but it demonstrates what happens when we install a package.

npm install camel-case
Now another file, package-lock.json is created. A folder called node_modules is also created. 
See what is inside the file and the folder. Then remove the package.

npm uninstall camel-case
See what happens to the package-lock.json file and node_modules folder.
