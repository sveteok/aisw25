9. Loops: Assignment 4.

The following function counts how many vowels there are in the given (English) sentence. 
However, it has some repetitive code that could be simplified away by splitting some of the code into a helper function.

Do the following:

a) Identify the repetitive bit of code

b) Create a helper function that performs the repetitive bit of code and returns a fitting value

c) Modify the checkSentenceVowels function so that it calls your helper function once for each vowel instead of having the same loop just copy-pasted 6 times for each vowel

The charAt function takes a letter of the string at the specified index. For example, for the string "abc", charAt(0) === 'a', chartAt(1) === 'b' and charAt(2) === 'c'.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Create a function getCountOfLetters that calculates the count of each letter in a string and returns the information, this time in an object.

For example:

const result = getCountOfLetters("a black cat");
console.log(result);
/* prints 
{
	a: 3,
	b: 1,
	c: 2,
	k: 1,
	l: 1,
	t: 1
}
