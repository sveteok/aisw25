Let us return to the robot in assignment 4.

There we had the x and y variables as globals (global variables). However, what if we want to have multiple robots?

Create a Robot class with x and y properties. Inside the class, also create a handleCommandList function that takes a command list (string) as a parameter and handles it exactly like in assignment 4, except that it must affect the x and y coordinates of the Robot class instance rather than global variables.

Create an instance of the class and run the "NNEESSWWCNNEEENNNCEESSSWNNNECEESWWNNNEEEBENNNEEE" command list through the robot. Print the robot afterwards and verify its coordinates to be x === 8, y === 7 to make sure your class works correctly.
