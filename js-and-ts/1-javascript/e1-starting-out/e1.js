/*
Create a working directory for your JavaScript exercises
Create a script that announces (prints) your first exercise as done.
Pro tip: name your files well! (instead of asdasd.js, something like exercise0.js)
Open command prompt and go to the working directory (you can also use VSC's terminal window for this)
Run the script!
