/*
Create two numbers, a and b. Compare them using all the comparison operators on the earlier slide and print out the results from the comparisons. For example:

const a = 3;
const b = 12;
console.log(a > b);
â€¦ and so on for all the operators (===, !==, >, <, >=, <=).

Try your code out with different values of a and b and check how it affects the results.
*/

const a = 3;
const b = 12;
console.log(a > b);
console.log(a === b);
console.log(a !== b);
console.log(a < b);
console.log(a >= b);
console.log(a <= b);
