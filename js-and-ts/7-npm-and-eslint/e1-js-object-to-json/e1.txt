Create a JS object with cars like this and save it as .js file
Convert the data into proper JSON -format by hand and save it into a new .json file

The idea is to see how JSON differs from a JS object.

const cars = [
  {
    registration: "abc-123",
    make: "Toyota",
    year: 1998,
  },
  {
    registration: "xyz-999",
    make: "Mercedes Benz",
    year: 2011,
  },
  {
    registration: "735-la",
    make: "Tesla",
    year: 2022,
  },
];
